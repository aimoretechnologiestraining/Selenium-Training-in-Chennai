Selenium Training - An Overview
Automation testing is gaining momentum nowadays. When discussing automation, one cannot overlook Selenium, which is regarded as one of the best tools for automation testing. Having a suite of tools that looks into the various requirements of organisations, Selenium supports important languages, including Java, JavaScript, Python, Perl, etc. The open-source nature of Selenium is one of its major advantages. Any organisation can deploy it to test its web applications. You can seamlessly test a website on any browser and can even perform a tiny modification to the code so that it fits your requirements with the help of Selenium.

While Selenium is a popular and widely-used choice, other frameworks like Playwright and Cypress serve as strong selenium alternatives and offer robust features for web application testing.
